# pseudo-keno
C# console application made for a beginners programming course.

## Assignment description
In this assignment you will work with arrays and random numbers.
Furthermore, you will show that you can loop (iterate) through an array in a suitable way (for- or foreach is often used).

In the assignment, the user must enter 10 numbers that are then stored in an array.
You must check that the user only enters numbers between 1 and 25.
When the user has entered 10 numbers, the game begins.

Now several numbers have to be randomly generated. The numbers that are randomly generated must also be stored in an array.
The code should now read all numbers entered by the user (in the array) and check their numbers against the randomly generated ones for any matches. If you get a match, you win, i.e.
that the number in the user's array is equal to a randomly generated number.
